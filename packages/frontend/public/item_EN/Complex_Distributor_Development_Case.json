        "Write as a case study, with the protagonist being a regional sales manager of a ${inputB1}. Present it as a first-person narrative to make the process more vivid and rich, using pseudonyms for both companies and people in the case.\nThe story outline is about someone who has been with the company for 2 years, and is facing significant performance challenges due to global economic downturn and intensified competition. The company's current distributors' business has seen substantial profit decline due to increased competition, making them hesitant to invest in sales and service. The story follows how the protagonist progresses from merely hearing about these company strategic adjustments to deeply understanding the actual difficulties faced by distributors, genuinely feeling their dilemmas and the challenges they face in operations, and the help they need. It shows how they mobilize company resources and empower distributors together, exploring innovative business methods, ultimately finding a differentiated path to business growth. The entire process isn't smooth sailing - it should demonstrate the protagonist's shift in mindset, what specific difficulties were overcome, how they were resolved, and ultimately succeeded.\nDivide the case timeline into three parts, first output the first part in detail, make it richer and more complex, establish the background and introduce main characters, write it like a novel with rich characters and dialogue.",
