Around the theme: ${inputB3} set up a large procurement project containing 5 sub-projects and their respective budgets, where 1 largest project is decided at the company group level, and other projects are decided by various business units. Among them, 4 are obviously matching with the player company's solutions, 1 is not so obvious and requires some customization from the player company to meet. The budget scale should be proportional to the number of decision-makers, with the number of decision-makers for each sub-project being:\nSub-project 1:${inputB4}+1\nSub-project 2:${inputB5}\nSub-project 3:${inputB6}\nSub-project 4:${inputB7}\nSub-project 5:${inputB8}\nWhen outputting detailed descriptions of sub-projects, you need to objectively state project requirements from the client's perspective, without mentioning the player's products and services (including overall project introduction and initial budget range and final confirmed budget (i.e., format like \"$xxxx-xxxx thousand, finally confirmed as $xxxx thousand\"), project description, project requirements, number of decision-makers, etc. Do not include requirement descriptions related to the player company's products.

Some projects are decided by a business unit, so decision-maker positions are people from that business unit) Output format: \"Sub-project number, Sub-project name, Sub-project brief, Decision-maker's name, Decision-maker's specific position, xx Decision-maker, Decision-maker number\". Must strictly meet the decision-maker quantity requirements for each business opportunity, must repeatedly check to ensure the total number of people for each business opportunity meets requirements: names should not be repeated, specific position names should not be repeated, no situation where one decision-maker participates in 2 projects, key decision-makers also do not participate in other key decision-makers' projects, give each person a number, incrementing from 1 with each person having a unique number. Assign 1 name (position is \"CEO\") and 1 name (position is \"New CEO\") to sub-project 1, both as key decision-makers, then assign new ${inputB4} people and generate appropriate positions as \"participating decision-makers\" for project 1 (i.e., project 1 has ${inputB4}+1 decision-makers total),\nAssign 1 most suitable key decision-maker to sub-project 2 and generate appropriate position, then assign new ${inputB5}-1 people as \"participating decision-makers\" and generate (i.e., sub-project 2 has ${inputB5} decision-makers total),\nAssign 1 most suitable key decision-maker to sub-project 3 and generate appropriate position, then assign new ${inputB6}-1 people as \"participating decision-makers\" and generate (i.e., sub-project 3 has ${inputB6} decision-makers total),\nAssign 1 most suitable key decision-maker to sub-project 4 and generate appropriate position, then assign new ${inputB7}-1 people as \"participating decision-makers\" and generate (i.e., sub-project 4 has ${inputB7} decision-makers total),\nAssign 1 most suitable key decision-maker to sub-project 5 and generate appropriate position, then assign new ${inputB8}-1 people as \"participating decision-makers\" and generate (i.e., sub-project 5 has ${inputB8} decision-makers total).\nOutput format: \"Sub-project number, Sub-project name, Sub-project brief, Decision-maker's name, Decision-maker's specific position, xx Decision-maker, Decision-maker number\".
