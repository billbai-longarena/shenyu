        "Here is the patient's basic information:\nGender: ${inputB1}\nAge: ${inputB2}\nSystolic Pressure: ${inputB3}\nDiastolic Pressure: ${inputB4}\nOther information, such as comorbidities: ${inputB5}\n\nBased on the following diagnostic criteria and drug list, make diagnosis and medication recommendations. Output format:\nPatient's hypertension status explanation: xxxxx\nRecommended medications, dosage, and reasons: xxxxxx\nPotential side effects to monitor: xxxxxxxx\nTarget blood pressure, medication evaluation period, and rare precautions: xxxxxx\nDisclaimer: xxxx\n\nDiagnostic criteria as follows:\nBlood Pressure Level Assessment and Classification\n\n\nMild Hypertension (140-159/90-99 mmHg)\nModerate Hypertension (160-179/100-109 mmHg)\nSevere Hypertension (≥180/110 mmHg)\n\n\nPatient Characteristics Consideration:\n\n\nAge:\n\n≥65 years elderly: Prefer CCB or diuretics, avoid dramatic pressure reduction\nMiddle-aged: All first-line medications are optional\n<55 years young: Can prioritize ACEI/ARB\n\n\nGender:\n\nWomen of childbearing age: ACEI/ARB contraindicated\nPost-menopausal women: Watch for osteoporosis risk, use diuretics with caution\n\n\n\n\nInitial Medication Principles:\n\n\nMild Hypertension: Start with single drug at low dose\nModerate to Severe Hypertension: Consider low-dose combination therapy\nSystolic >20mmHg or Diastolic >10mmHg above target: Consider dual therapy\n\n\nSpecial Conditions Consideration:\n\n\nIsolated Systolic Hypertension: Prefer CCB or diuretics\nWith Heart Failure: Prefer ACEI/ARB + β-blockers\nWith Diabetes: Prioritize ACEI/ARB\nWith Renal Dysfunction: Prioritize ACEI/ARB (unless severe renal impairment)\n\n\nMonitoring and Adjustment Principles:\n\n\nEvaluate efficacy and tolerability after 2 weeks of initial treatment\nConsider adjusting regimen if target not reached within 4-6 weeks\nMonitor electrolytes and renal function\nPay attention to patient compliance and lifestyle improvements\n\nDrug List as follows:\n\nCalcium Channel Blockers (CCB)\n\n\nAmlodipine: Reduces BP 8-12/4-6 mmHg (systolic/diastolic)\nMain side effects: Ankle edema, headache, facial flushing, tachycardia\nInteractions: Avoid with grapefruit juice; use with caution with β-blockers, may worsen cardiac conduction block\n\n\nAngiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI)\n\n\nCaptopril/Enalapril: Reduces BP 8-12/4-8 mmHg\nMain side effects: Dry cough (10-20% patients), hyperkalemia, angioedema\nInteractions: Contraindicated with ARB; avoid with potassium-sparing diuretics; contraindicated in pregnancy\n\n\nAngiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB)\n\n\nValsartan/Telmisartan: Reduces BP 8-11/5-7 mmHg\nMain side effects: Dizziness, hyperkalemia (lower incidence than ACEI)\nInteractions: Contraindicated with ACEI; avoid with potassium-sparing diuretics; contraindicated in pregnancy\n\n\nThiazide Diuretics\n\n\nHydrochlorothiazide: Reduces BP 9-13/4-6 mmHg\nMain side effects: Hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia\nInteractions: Avoid with glucocorticoids; may increase lithium toxicity risk when combined with lithium\n\n\nβ-Blockers\n\n\nMetoprolol/Bisoprolol: Reduces BP 8-10/6-8 mmHg\nMain side effects: Fatigue, bradycardia, bronchospasm, masks hypoglycemia symptoms\nInteractions: Avoid with verapamil-type calcium channel blockers; monitor blood glucose when used with insulin/sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents"
