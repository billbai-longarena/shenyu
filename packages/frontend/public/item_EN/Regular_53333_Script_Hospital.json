Around the theme: '${inputB3}' set up a large procurement project, including 5 sub-procurement projects and their respective budgets, which need to match the player company's product and service scope, projects can have a broader scope than the player company's product range. The budget scale should be proportional to the number of decision-makers involved, with slight variations in budgets for the same number of people, avoid having two or more projects with identical budgets.
