export const agentPromptTemplate2 = 'Based on the user\'s input: "${input}" and AI \'s initial feedback design of the JSON: "${promptResults1}", first check if the json using <def></def> correctly. make sure the promptBlocks number is fullfill the user\'s request(if have). then optimize the prompt words in the JSON\'s promptBlock. Since inputB1-N is input by the user at once, promptBlock1-N can be captured by placeholders at any time. The promptBlock should be written with an optimal strategy. Unless a large amount of complex writing is required, the problem should generally be solved in one promptBlock. Since AI\'s response to each promptblock is limited to around 4000 characters, when determining that the client needs output (such as long articles), use multiple promptBlocks for multiple segmented outputs. Therefore, promptBlock2-n must contain at least one promptBlock placeholder and its content description to maintain context. The JSON file is essentially a questionnaire where users will input inputB1-N, with the <def> tag representing the default value for that input. After clicking submit, the program will sequentially call the strings in promptBlock1-N to the AI and return the content to the user in order. You need to optimize the prompt words in promptBlock: 1. Ensure promptBlock1\'s prompt words correctly reference the user\'s input ${inputBn}, ensure subsequent prompt words correctly reference their previous context ${promptBlockn} or user\'s input (if needed), where n is an integer from 1-n representing the control number. Each promptblock must have at least one ${} placeholder, whether it\'s input or promptblock. Here\'s an example of multiple promptBlocks:\n"{\n"adminInputs": {\n"inputB1": "Animal 1 <def>Cat</def>",\n"inputB2": "Animal 2 <def>Dog</def>",\n"inputB3": "Animal 3 <def>Chicken</def>"\n},\n"promptBlocks": {\n"promptBlock1": "List one breed for each of the following animals, and only output the breed name without other irrelevant information. ${inputB1} ${inputB2} ${inputB3}",\n"promptBlock2": "Which one do you like the most: ${promptBlock1}". Multi-section article context reference example: { "adminInputs": { "inputB1": "Article topic <def>About technology development trends</def>", "inputB2": "Main content of each section <def>First section introduces background, second section analyzes current situation, third section discusses impacts, fourth section predicts future, fifth section concludes</def>", "inputB3": "Article style <def>Formal and academic</def>", "inputB4": "Target audience <def>Professionals</def>", "inputB5": "Whether to cite data or cases <def>Yes, need latest data and relevant cases</def>" }, "promptBlocks": { "promptBlock1": "Based on the provided basic information, generate the first section content, mainly introducing the background of technology development trends. Topic: ${inputB1}, Section content: ${inputB2}, Style: ${inputB3}, Target audience: ${inputB4}, Data citation: ${inputB5}", "promptBlock2": "Here\'s the first section content: ${promptBlock1}\\n\\nBased on the first section content and basic information, generate the second section content, mainly analyzing the current situation of technology development.", "promptBlock3": "Here are the first two sections content: ${promptBlock1}\\n${promptBlock2}\\n\\nBased on the previous two sections content and basic information, generate the third section content, mainly discussing the impacts of technology development.", "promptBlock4": "Here are the first three sections content: ${promptBlock1}\\n${promptBlock2}\\n${promptBlock3}\\n\\nBased on the previous three sections content and basic information, generate the fourth section content, mainly predicting future technology development trends.", "promptBlock5": "Here are the first four sections content: ${promptBlock1}\\n${promptBlock2}\\n${promptBlock3}\\n${promptBlock4}\\n\\nBased on the previous four sections content and basic information, generate the fifth section content, summarizing the entire article and providing conclusions." } }. Check that each promptblock output has at least one ${} placeholder, whether it\'s input or promptblock. Directly output one final optimized JSON file, without outputting any other content such as explanations or descriptions.';
